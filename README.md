# Web-Based-Calculator-App

**Scenario**

A Simple Web based calculator which can perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It also has a display field which shows the inputs and  results of the operations, has a clear button to reset and display. It has a user interface with 0 to 9 digits, decimal point and arithmetic oprration (+, -, ร, รท). 

Testing if the app is clear to release and performing each test case to see if any issues occuring and comparing the expected result and actual result to pass the test cases and release the app.


****TEST CASE****

**TEST Planning**:

Objective: Testing the functionality of the app
Scope: Test basic arithmetic operations
Approach: Manual Testing

**TEST CASE DESIGN**:

Positive Test Cases
1. Test addiing, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.
2. Test the clear button
3. Test the decimal calculations (checking if its giving the approx value and rounding behaviour)

Negative Test Cases:
1. Test the error message if divided by 0.
2. Test the input limit on the display

**Test Execution**

Manually testing the app in all the possible ways to get the expected output.

Documenting the operations performed and comparing the actual result and expected result values and note down the errors found.

Check all the defects in the app after performing the operations.
